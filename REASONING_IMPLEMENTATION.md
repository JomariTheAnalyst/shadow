# Reasoning Parts Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Phase 1 implementation of AI SDK ReasoningPart and RedactedReasoningPart support throughout the Shadow codebase. This enables the system to properly handle and stream Claude's extended thinking/reasoning capabilities.

## Phase 1: Backend Implementation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

### What Was Implemented

Complete backend support for reasoning chunks flowing from AI SDK through the server pipeline to WebSocket emission. Frontend consumption is Phase 2.

### Legacy "Thinking" Removal (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

Removed legacy unused "thinking" functionality in favor of the new reasoning implementation:
- Removed `"thinking"` from StreamChunk type union
- Removed `thinking?: string` field from StreamChunk interface
- Removed `thinking?: { content: string; duration: number }` from MessageMetadata
- Removed frontend thinking case handler (was just console logging)
- All TypeScript compilation passes
- No remaining "thinking" references found in codebase

### Key Findings from Research

- **Multiple Reasoning Blocks**: Messages CAN have multiple reasoning blocks, often interleaved with text and tool calls
- **Signature Purpose**: Each reasoning block gets exactly ONE signature for cryptographic verification and completion marking
- **AI SDK Support**: Latest AI SDK versions support reasoning models across providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Type Definitions

#### Added to `packages/types/src/chat/messages.ts`:
```typescript
// Reasoning part types (AI SDK compatible)
export interface ReasoningPart {
  type: "reasoning";
  text: string;
  signature?: string;
}

export interface RedactedReasoningPart {
  type: "redacted-reasoning";
  data: string;
}

// Extended AssistantMessagePart union
export type AssistantMessagePart =
  | TextPart
  | ToolCallPart
  | ToolResultPart
  | ReasoningPart       // NEW
  | RedactedReasoningPart // NEW
  | ErrorPart;
```

#### Added to `packages/types/src/llm/streaming-ai-sdk.ts`:
```typescript
export interface ReasoningChunk {
  type: "reasoning";
  textDelta: string;
}

export interface ReasoningSignatureChunk {
  type: "reasoning-signature";
  signature: string;
}

export interface RedactedReasoningChunk {
  type: "redacted-reasoning";
  data: string;
}

// Updated AIStreamChunk union to include new types
```

#### Added to `packages/types/src/chat/streaming-client.ts`:
```typescript
// Added to StreamChunk type union
type: "reasoning" | "reasoning-signature" | "redacted-reasoning"

// Added reasoning fields
reasoning?: string;              // Incremental reasoning text delta
reasoningSignature?: string;     // Verification signature
redactedReasoningData?: string;  // Complete redacted reasoning block
```

### 2. Stream Processing

#### Chunk Handlers (`apps/server/src/agent/llm/streaming/chunk-handlers.ts`):
```typescript
handleReasoning(chunk: AIStreamChunk & { type: "reasoning" }): StreamChunk | null
handleReasoningSignature(chunk: AIStreamChunk & { type: "reasoning-signature" }): StreamChunk | null  
handleRedactedReasoning(chunk: AIStreamChunk & { type: "redacted-reasoning" }): StreamChunk | null
```

#### Stream Processor (`apps/server/src/agent/llm/streaming/stream-processor.ts`):
Added case handlers in main switch statement:
```typescript
case "reasoning": {
  const streamChunk = this.chunkHandlers.handleReasoning(chunk);
  if (streamChunk) yield streamChunk;
  break;
}
// ... similar for reasoning-signature and redacted-reasoning
```

### 3. Message Building Logic

#### Chat Service (`apps/server/src/agent/chat.ts`):

**State Tracking Variables:**
```typescript
// Track active reasoning parts for signature association
let activeReasoningParts: Map<number, ReasoningPart> = new Map();
let reasoningCounter = 0;
```

**Reasoning Chunk Processing:**
- **`reasoning` chunks**: Accumulate text deltas into reasoning parts
- **`reasoning-signature` chunks**: Finalize reasoning parts and add to message
- **`redacted-reasoning` chunks**: Add complete redacted reasoning parts

**Multiple Reasoning Blocks Support:**
- Each reasoning block gets tracked separately by `reasoningCounter`
- Signatures mark completion of current block and increment counter
- Final cleanup handles any incomplete reasoning parts

## How Multiple Reasoning Blocks Work

### Stream Flow Example:
```
reasoning(delta: "First, let me consider...")     // Block 0 starts
reasoning(delta: " the user's request...")        // Block 0 continues
reasoning-signature(sig: "sig1")                  // Block 0 finalized ‚Üí counter = 1

reasoning(delta: "Next, I should think about...")  // Block 1 starts  
reasoning(delta: " the implementation...")         // Block 1 continues
reasoning-signature(sig: "sig2")                  // Block 1 finalized ‚Üí counter = 2
```

### Final Message Parts:
```typescript
[
  { type: "reasoning", text: "First, let me consider the user's request...", signature: "sig1" },
  { type: "reasoning", text: "Next, I should think about the implementation...", signature: "sig2" }
]
```

## Reasoning Signatures Explained

### Purpose:
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Proves reasoning actually came from AI model
- **Integrity Check**: Ensures reasoning text wasn't tampered with
- **Completion Marker**: Signals end of a reasoning block
- **Audit Trail**: Provides cryptographic proof for compliance

### Pattern:
- Each distinct reasoning block gets exactly ONE signature
- Signature arrives after all text deltas for that block
- Used as both completion signal AND authenticity proof

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Phase 1 + Phase 2):
**Backend (Phase 1):**
- AI SDK reasoning chunks are captured and processed
- Reasoning content flows through server pipeline  
- WebSocket emits reasoning chunks to frontend clients
- Reasoning parts stored in database for persistence
- Multiple reasoning blocks per message handled correctly

**Frontend (Phase 2):**
- Frontend processes all reasoning chunk types correctly
- Reasoning content flows through to streaming parts map
- Multi-block reasoning works on frontend
- Stream state recovery works for reasoning content
- Ready for UI component consumption

**System-Wide:**
- TypeScript compilation passes for all packages
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Legacy "thinking" code completely removed

### üìã Testing Completed:
- TypeScript type checking passes across all packages
- All packages compile successfully
- Frontend reasoning state management tested
- Stream state recovery logic implemented

### üîç How to Test:
1. **WebSocket Inspection**: Browser dev tools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS tab during Claude 4 chat
2. **Database Verification**: Check message metadata after stream completion  
3. **Console Monitoring**: Server logs show reasoning chunk processing
4. **Frontend State**: Console log streaming parts map to see reasoning parts

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Frontend Parts Processing**: Updated `apps/frontend/hooks/socket/use-task-socket.ts`
   ‚úÖ Added reasoning imports (`ReasoningPart`, `RedactedReasoningPart`)
   ‚úÖ Added reasoning state tracking variables (`activeReasoningParts`, `reasoningCounter`)
   ‚úÖ Updated `clearStreamingState` to reset reasoning state
   ‚úÖ Implemented reasoning chunk handling in `onStreamChunk`:
   
   ```typescript
   case "reasoning":
     // Accumulates reasoning text for current block
     // Tracks reasoning block IDs for multiple blocks
     
   case "reasoning-signature":  
     // Finalizes current reasoning part with signature
     // Adds to streaming parts map and increments counter
     
   case "redacted-reasoning":
     // Adds complete redacted reasoning part immediately
   ```

2. **Stream State Recovery**: Updated `onStreamState` 
   ‚úÖ Reconstruct reasoning parts from chunk history on reconnection
   ‚úÖ Handle reasoning counter state properly during replay
   ‚úÖ Process incomplete reasoning parts correctly
   ‚úÖ Update frontend reasoning state to match replayed state

3. **Stream Completion Cleanup**: 
   ‚úÖ Added cleanup logic in "complete" case to finalize remaining reasoning parts
   ‚úÖ Removed legacy thinking display code from `assistant-message.tsx`
   ‚úÖ All TypeScript compilation passes

### Implementation Details:

**Frontend State Management:**
- `activeReasoningParts: Map<number, ReasoningPart>` - tracks incomplete reasoning blocks
- `reasoningCounter: number` - provides unique IDs for reasoning blocks  
- State is reset in `clearStreamingState()` and properly managed during reconnection

**Multi-Block Reasoning Support:**
- Each reasoning block gets tracked separately by counter ID
- Signatures mark completion and finalize parts into streaming parts map
- Counter increments ensure unique block identification
- Incomplete parts are handled gracefully on stream completion

**Parts Integration:**
- Reasoning parts added to streaming parts map with stable IDs (`reasoning-${counter}`)
- Proper order maintained in `streamingPartsOrder`
- Follows existing patterns for part ID generation

## Configuration Notes

### AI SDK Configuration:
The reasoning functionality is already enabled in `stream-processor.ts`:
```typescript
const reasoningProviderOptions = {
  anthropic: {
    thinking: {
      type: "enabled", 
      budgetTokens: 12000,
    },
  },
  openai: {
    reasoningEffort: "high",
  },
};
```

### Supported Models:
- Anthropic: Claude 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude Opus 4
- OpenAI: Reasoning models (o1, o1-mini, etc.)
- Other providers as AI SDK adds support

## Files Modified

### Type Definitions:
- `packages/types/src/chat/messages.ts`

- Stream interruption/reconnection
- Multiple reasoning blocks per message

### Performance Considerations:
- Efficient Map-based tracking for active reasoning parts
- Minimal database updates during streaming
- Existing WebSocket infrastructure reused

### Security:
- Reasoning signatures preserved for verification
- No modification of reasoning content
- Cryptographic integrity maintained

## Next Steps

**Phase 3 (Future): UI Components**
When ready to display reasoning to users:
1. Create reasoning display components (expandable/collapsible)
2. Add reasoning parts rendering in `assistant-message.tsx`
3. Style reasoning blocks to differentiate from regular text
4. Add signature verification UI (optional)
5. Test end-to-end reasoning display
