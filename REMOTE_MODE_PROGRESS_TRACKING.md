## üöß What's Missing for Full System Design

**Missing Components**:
1. **Firecracker microVMs** - Currently using Docker containers instead
2. **Persistent Storage (EFS)** - Using ephemeral emptyDir volumes
3. **Artifact Storage (S3)** - Database model exists but no implementation
4. **Enhanced Terminal Streaming** - Basic streaming without circular buffers
5. **Serial Console Integration** - Using process stdout instead of VM console

## **Phase 5: Storage Infrastructure** üì¶

### 5.1 EFS Integration
- [ ] Configure EFS CSI driver in Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Create EFS-backed PersistentVolumes for workspaces  
- [ ] Update `RemoteWorkspaceManager` to use EFS PVCs instead of emptyDir
- [ ] Implement workspace cleanup policies
- [ ] Add shared build cache support

### 5.2 S3 Artifact Management
- [ ] Implement `S3ArtifactManager` service
- [ ] Connect database `Artifact` model to actual S3 operations

- [ ] Implement session log archival  
- [ ] Create user download endpoints for artifacts

### 5.3 Storage Configuration

## **Deployment Strategy**

1. **Parallel Development**: Keep Docker-based system running while developing Firecracker
2. **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables to toggle between container/VM modes
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy storage first, then terminal, then VM integration
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts during transition

---

## **Current System Strengths** ‚úÖ

- **Solid Abstraction Layer**: Dual-mode execution makes Firecracker integration straightforward
- **Complete Tool System**: All agent tools implemented and tested
- **Real-time Infrastructure**: WebSocket system ready for VM serial console
- **Production-Ready Base**: Auth, database, Kubernetes deployment all working
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration tests and error handling in place

The system is **functional today** as a coding agent platform. These phases will make it **production-grade** with the security, persistence, and scalability of the original architectural vision.
