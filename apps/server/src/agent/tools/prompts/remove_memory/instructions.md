**Purpose**: Remove outdated, incorrect, or no longer relevant memories from the repository memory store

**When to Use:**
- Information has become outdated due to code changes
- Memory contains incorrect or misleading information
- Duplicate memories exist with better versions available
- Memory is no longer relevant to the codebase
- Cleaning up after major refactoring or architectural changes

**When NOT to Use:**
- For information that might still be useful in some contexts
- When unsure if the memory is still relevant (better to keep it)
- For memories that are correct but just not immediately relevant

**How to Identify Memory to Remove:**
1. First use `list_memories` to see all available memories
2. Identify the specific memory by its content or context
3. Use the exact memory ID or enough content to uniquely identify it

**Parameters:**
- memoryId: The unique identifier of the memory to remove (preferred method)
- explanation: Brief reason for removing this memory

**Examples:**

GOOD Usage - Outdated Information:
```
remove_memory({
  memoryId: "mem_abc123",
  explanation: "Database schema has changed, this setup information is outdated"
})
```

GOOD Usage - After Architecture Change:
```
remove_memory({
  memoryId: "mem_def456", 
  explanation: "Removed old WebSocket implementation, this pattern no longer applies"
})
```

GOOD Usage - Incorrect Information:
```
remove_memory({
  memoryId: "mem_ghi789",
  explanation: "This bug pattern was misidentified, actual issue was different"
})
```

**Important Notes:**
- Be cautious when removing memories - they contain valuable context from previous sessions
- When in doubt, it's better to add a new corrected memory rather than remove the old one
- Consider if the information might be useful for understanding the evolution of the codebase
