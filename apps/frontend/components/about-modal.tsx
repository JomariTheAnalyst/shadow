                Shadow is a powerful AI coding agent designed to work alongside
                developers, understanding your codebase and helping you build
                better software. Think of it as having an intelligent coding
                partner that can read your entire project, understand the
                context, and help you implement features, fix bugs, and improve
                your code.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-pretty leading-relaxed">
                Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that work in isolation,
                Shadow integrates deeply with your GitHub repositories. It can
                analyze your entire codebase, understand the relationships
                between files, and provide contextually relevant suggestions
                that actually make sense for your specific project.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground text-pretty leading-relaxed">
                Shadow transforms your codebase into an intelligent development
                environment. When you connect a repository, it performs a deep
                analysis of your entire codebase, examining individual files and
                the complex relationships between them.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-pretty text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Shadow uses tree-sitter parsers for JavaScript, TypeScript,
                  and TSX to extract symbols, function definitions, and import
                  statements. It builds a semantic graph of your codebase with
                  GraphNode and GraphEdge relationships.

                  The system creates hierarchical summaries using the buildTree
                  function, processing files in batches with dynamic sizing. It
                  uses different modelsâ€”faster models for file analysis and more
                  powerful models for directory summaries. We only look for the
                  most important information and refer to call graphs more than
                  reading calls, meaning we can understand codebase architecture
                  in ~ 10 seconds, instead of 10 minutes. We have found our
                  optimized algorithm provides enough information for language
                  models, as we are not optimizing for human understanding.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-pretty text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Shadow uses a repository-specific memory system that stores
                  knowledge about your codebase. Memories are categorized and
                  linked to specific tasks, allowing the AI to recall previous
                  decisions and patterns when working on similar problems.

                  Code is processed through an embedding pipeline using models
                  like Jina or local transformers. The system creates vector
                  embeddings that are stored in Pinecone for efficient semantic
                  search, enabling natural language queries to find relevant
                  code.

                  Shadow supports both local and remote execution modes. Remote
                  mode uses Kata QEMU containers on AWS EKS with hardware-level
                  VM isolation. Each task runs in its own isolated environment

                Using Shadow feels like having a coding partner who knows your
                project inside and out. Connect your repository, and within
                seconds, Shadow has a deep understanding of your codebase that
                it can leverage for any task.

                When you create a task, you get a collaborative development

                make intelligent modifications, and create pull requests when
                you&apos;re ready to merge changes.

                Shadow runs on AWS with production-grade infrastructure. The
