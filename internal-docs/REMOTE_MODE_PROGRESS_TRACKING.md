## üöß What's Missing for Full System Design

**Missing Components**:
1. **Firecracker microVMs** - Currently using Docker containers instead
2. **Enhanced Git Integration** - Basic git operations, needs branch management and commit strategies
3. **Enhanced Terminal Streaming** - Basic streaming without circular buffers
4. **Serial Console Integration** - Using process stdout instead of VM console

- [ ] Add consistent commit strategies during agent execution
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution for concurrent git operations
- [ ] Add robust push/pull mechanisms with retry logic
- [ ] Create git-based state recovery for pod restarts

### 5.2 Agent Tool Enhancements

## **Deployment Strategy**

1. **Parallel Development**: Keep Docker-based system running while developing Firecracker

## **Current System Strengths** ‚úÖ

- **Solid Abstraction Layer**: Dual-mode execution makes Firecracker integration straightforward
- **Complete Tool System**: All agent tools implemented and tested
- **Real-time Infrastructure**: WebSocket system ready for VM serial console
- **Production-Ready Base**: Auth, database, Kubernetes deployment all working
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration tests and error handling in place

The system is **functional today** as a coding agent platform. These phases will make it **production-grade** with the security, persistence, and scalability of the original architectural vision.
